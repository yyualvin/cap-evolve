# The prompt — onboard tau2-bench airline as a new benchmark and optimize it

Paste this to your coding agent (Claude Code) at the cap-evolve repo root and say
**"follow RUN.md."** Intake treats this as a brand-new benchmark: the integration
step **clones + installs tau2-bench**, wires Vertex Claude (litellm `vertex_ai/`),
writes the adapter, runs the `cap-evolve check` gate, then the full optimize →
gate → sealed-test → report loop with a live dashboard. Everything below is the
input intake needs.

```text
Follow RUN.md to run a cap-evolve optimization. Onboard this as a brand-new
benchmark — the intake/integration step should CLONE + INSTALL it (not assume it
exists). Here is everything intake needs:

# 1. CAPABILITY TO OPTIMIZE  (a copy is edited each iteration; the original is never touched)
- type:         [skill-package, tools]      # Agent Skill (SKILL.md = live policy) + TOOLS, jointly
- tools means:  edit tool docstrings/descriptions; edit tool behavior/code; and
                ADD/REMOVE tools, including composite tools that call existing tools
- seed:         a minimal airline Agent Skill (SKILL.md) + tau2's airline tool set
- seed tools:   the seed tools file must be CLEAN, runnable code as intake would
                produce it — real tool bodies, no baked-in optimizer/editing
                instructions in its docstrings (what the optimizer may change to the
                tools lives in the tools capability SKILL.md, not in the seed file)
- capability_sources:  set `capability_sources` to the benchmark's data-model/types
                module(s) the tools import (here tau2's airline data_model — the source
                of FlightDB, Reservation, Passenger, Payment, etc.). cap-evolve copies
                these verbatim into the optimizer's workdir so it can write correct
                new-tool code against the real types.

# 2. BENCHMARK / DATASET  (the eval) — INSTALL IT DURING INTAKE
- benchmark:    tau2-bench, airline domain
- repo:         https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench   (latest main; record the resolved commit)
- install:      git clone as a sibling dir ../tau2-bench, then `pip install -e ../tau2-bench`
- tasks:        "adapter" — the adapter loads all 50 airline tasks from tau2
                (tau2.domains.airline.environment.get_tasks)
- splits:       all 50 tasks as train = val = test  (no-holdout fit metric; the engine
                logs a splits_warning and the report flags the test number as a fit metric)

# 3. RUNNER  (the agent under test) + MODELS + CREDENTIALS
- how to run:   tau2's own batch runner (adapter.run_batch -> tau2.runner.run_tasks)
- fast eval:    ALSO implement the optional adapter method
                run_trials(tasks, ctx, *, n_trials, base_seed) -> {task_id: [Rollout, ...]}.
                Run ALL num_trials in ONE tau2 run_tasks call with num_trials=N (grouped by
                sim.trial) at TAU2_MAX_CONCURRENCY=125, and return {task_id: [trial0, trial1, ...]}
                (len n_trials, trial-ordered). When present, cap-evolve calls it ONCE per candidate
                instead of looping run_batch per trial; per-trial persistence
                (rollouts/<split>/<task>__<tag>__t<k>.json) is UNCHANGED so pass^k / SE / resume
                keep working. This collapses N sequential eval passes into one batched run.
- agent AND user simulator:  claude-sonnet-4-6 via Vertex AI (default)
- Vertex wiring: litellm model "vertex_ai/claude-sonnet-4-6" + llm_args
                vertex_project / vertex_location (NO litellm monkeypatch, NO tau2 fork,
                NO AnthropicVertex SDK — tau2 calls litellm.completion)
- credentials:  GCP ADC (gcloud auth application-default login or
                GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS); defaults project
                itpc-gcp-octo-eng-claude, location global (override VERTEXAI_PROJECT /
                VERTEXAI_LOCATION). RITS (hosted_vllm/...) and IBM Anthropic gateway
                (anthropic/...) remain available via TAU2_AGENT_MODEL / TAU2_USER_MODEL.
- concurrency:  TAU2_MAX_CONCURRENCY=125

# 4. SCORER  (what to optimize against) — and WHERE the metric comes from
- metric:       tau2's own task reward in [0,1] (required actions performed + info communicated)
- metric source: tau2 computes it per simulation as `sim.reward_info.reward`; the per-check
                breakdown is in `sim.reward_info` (db_check / action_checks / communicate_checks /
                nl_assertions / env_assertions). Implement adapter.score() to read the reward +
                reward_info that run_batch stashes from each simulation, and verify score() is
                deterministic on a fixed rollout (the `cap-evolve check` gate enforces this).
- feedback:     gold-AWARE but gold-SAFE, and ARGUMENT-LEVEL — this IS the learning signal, so a
                tool-name-only message ("action X was wrong") is too coarse: the optimizer can only
                pattern-match to prose rules and plateaus. Implement score()'s feedback so that for
                EACH failing check it localizes the defect at the argument level:
                  * for each mismatched write/action, name the differing ARGUMENT key + the AGENT'S
                    OWN wrong value (e.g. "book_reservation: payment_id='credit_card_9' is not on the
                    user's profile; available=[credit_card_4421, gift_card_8]"; "update_reservation_flights:
                    called on reservation res_A but the task targets a different one");
                  * for communicate misses, name the un-stated value when derivable from the agent's
                    own state (e.g. "did not state the computed total cost ($150 from your own observed
                    amounts)").
                Gold-SAFE: NEVER read or print the gold/expected value — derive everything from the
                agent's OWN messages/tool-calls and the user's OWN profile/db state (parsed from the
                agent's get_user_details/get_reservation_details tool results in the trace). Use
                reward_info only to know WHICH action/argument failed (the gold action's arg KEYS are
                safe; its VALUES are not). Fall back to the tool-name message when a piece isn't safely
                derivable. score() must stay deterministic on a fixed rollout.
- objective:    maximize mean reward on the VAL split

# 4b. TRAJECTORIES  (the FULL traces the optimizer reads) — PATH IS AN INPUT
- where:        tau2's batch runner can persist its native per-task simulation results
                (full message transcript + reward_info) to a directory via run_tasks(save_path=...).
                Point run_batch's save_path at a per-eval dir UNDER THE RUN, e.g.
                <run_dir>/trajectories/val/  (any structure/format tau2 writes is fine).
- expose:       implement adapter.trajectories(split) to return that directory. cap-evolve copies
                it VERBATIM into the optimizer's working dir as ./trajectories/ each iteration, so
                the optimizer reads the complete, unmodified traces (not a lossy summary).
                (If you cannot persist native files, return None — cap-evolve falls back to copying
                its own per-rollout JSON, which already embeds each rollout's full message trace.)

# 5. OPTIMIZER  (proposes the edits) + MODEL + CREDENTIALS + CONTEXT
- optimizer:    claude-code
- model:        claude-opus-4-6
- credentials:  a logged-in Claude Code session (or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- runner_repo_path:  ../tau2-bench  (the cloned checkout — surfaced to the optimizer as
                read-only context so it can consult tau2's tools/scoring/task structure)
- optimizer instructions: author .capevolve/project/optimizer/INSTRUCTIONS.md from the scaffolded
                template (keep its {{...}} placeholders intact — the harness fills them per
                iteration). Keep it short on meta-narration but explicit and DEMANDING on iteration
                depth, and impose a DEPTH MANDATE: state the GOAL (maximize the eval score) and require
                each iteration to be a substantial multi-cluster, multi-edit-class sweep — improve
                multiple tools' code + validation + enriched returns/errors, add new tools, sharpen
                many tool docs, AND fix the prompt, together in ONE candidate, with each fix scoped to
                protect passing tasks (non-regression). "Freedom" does NOT mean do little — a single
                small edit is an under-used iteration; diagnose ALL clusters and fix as many as
                possible. CRITICAL — the authored INSTRUCTIONS MUST demand BREADTH: each iteration
                diagnoses EVERY failure cluster in the trajectories and ships a fix for as many of them
                as pass the three tests (REAL/SAFE/VERIFIED) in this ONE candidate — solving many issues
                across many trajectories, not just the biggest. A one- or two-edit iteration is
                under-used; the only edits left out are the speculative ones that fail a test. The
                authored INSTRUCTIONS MUST also encode all three: (i) a STEP-0 reading
                mandate — "read ./guidance/<cap>/SKILL.md (for EACH selected cap) + ./guidance/optimizer/
                before diagnosing"; (ii) the EXISTING-tool-code mandate — "convert violated rules into
                in-code checks across MANY EXISTING tool bodies; most violated rules govern a tool that
                already exists, so the fix is an in-body guard there, not a new tool — a docstring-only
                iteration (or one that only adds a single new tool + rewords docstrings, leaving rules as
                prose) is under-used"; (iii) the explicit TWO-PHASE subagent pattern — Phase 1 diagnose
                fan-out (one read-only subagent per trajectory-group → tight issue list; main dedups into
                clusters), Phase 2 implement fan-out (one edit-subagent per ISSUE, each in its own
                worktree, each PREFERRING to edit the EXISTING tool's code body to enforce its rule), then
                merge all edits into ONE candidate. The authored INSTRUCTIONS MUST also encode: (iv) the
                NON-OVERFITTING guardrail — every prompt/tool edit must be a GENERAL rule/policy/validation
                that generalizes across the class of inputs; NEVER hardcode a task-specific
                id/value/date/name/answer (a guard fires on the general condition, e.g. "payment_id not on
                the user's profile", NOT `if reservation_id == "ABC123"`); a literal special-case overfits,
                fails the held-out gate, and hurts other tasks; per-task specifics are for understanding the
                failure CLASS only; and (v) EXPLOIT GROUND TRUTH for diagnosis — when ./trajectories/ include
                ground-truth/expected actions/a reward breakdown (tau2's native trajectories include
                reward_info with the per-check breakdown), USE it to localize the exact defect (expected vs
                actual action/argument/value), but keep the resulting edit GENERAL (guardrail iv) and never
                copy a gold value into the prompt or tool code. Tailor only the "READ THESE" pointers
                (./trajectories/, ./guidance/<cap>/SKILL.md for EACH selected capability,
                ./guidance/diagnose/SKILL.md, ./guidance/optimizer/claude-code.md, ./guidance/sources/
                [the data model], ./LEDGER.md, ./JOURNAL.md, ./RUNMAP.md + ./prior_iterations/,
                ./PROCESS.md, ../tau2-bench).
- (vi) the CROSS-ITERATION FILE CONTRACT + NEW-TOOLS-FIRST-CLASS mandate — the authored
                INSTRUCTIONS must tell the optimizer to READ all four cross-iteration files first
                (LEDGER facts, the whole JOURNAL handover, RUNMAP + prior_iterations diffs/PROCESS),
                each iteration FILL ./PROCESS.md (required explainability: ranked issues with
                KNOWLEDGE/BEHAVIORAL/CAPABILITY-GAP tags, every edit + class, verify-the-fix,
                subagents/features used, what to preserve, what was skipped) and APPEND its entry to
                ./JOURNAL.md (tried/worked/regressed/refuted/plateau-signal/focus-next); and it must
                require MULTIPLE edit classes per iteration and ADD at least one NEW code-bearing tool
                (composite atomic-WRITE / loop / validation) whenever a CAPABILITY-GAP or action-STALL
                cluster is present — adding new tools is ENCOURAGED, not an exception.
- scope to the SELECTED capabilities: BOTH skill-package and tools are selected here, so the
                instructions reference BOTH skills and the optimizer may edit EITHER. (Generic rule: if
                only ONE capability were selected, the instructions, the guidance, and the editable
                files must cover ONLY that one — e.g. tools-only ⇒ no skill-package guidance, no
                SKILL.md presented as editable.)
- EDIT BOTH the skill package AND the tools — they are EQUALLY fair game; pick whatever fixes the clusters:
    * SKILL PACKAGE, per ./guidance/skill-package/SKILL.md: edit SKILL.md (frontmatter + body),
      references/, and bundled scripts under skill-creator rules (valid frontmatter, progressive
      disclosure, concise body). Recover missing domain rules into the skill or references; do not
      bloat the body — factor detail into references/. The skill body is flattened into tau2's
      policy= string at eval time.
    * TOOLS, per ./guidance/tools/SKILL.md: prefer CODE-BEARING changes — a validation tool that
      enforces a rule in code then calls the existing tool and removes the raw one; a workflow/loop
      tool that collapses a recurring sequence; a composite WRITE tool that performs a stalled
      multi-step action in code (then removes the raw write primitives) so the agent can't analyze,
      confirm, then fail to execute. Improve tool docs AND RETURN VALUES (actionable errors + next
      steps) — the docstring and return are what the agent sees. Never bare-remove a tool — add a
      replacement that calls it, verify, then swap registration.
- process flow: READ ./LEDGER.md + the whole ./JOURNAL.md + ./RUNMAP.md (and the
                ./prior_iterations/ entries for clusters you'll touch) FIRST (don't re-submit a
                rejected edit verbatim — a redesigned version may still work; don't abandon a
                high-value cluster); analyze the current best step's ./trajectories/; use LEDGER's
                per-task broke/fixed columns + the currently-passing tasks the harness lists to steer
                AWAY from regressions (don't re-introduce a change that broke a task) WITHOUT freezing;
                make a bold, multi-part edit across the selected capabilities (multiple edit classes,
                incl. a NEW tool for any capability-gap/stall cluster), scoping each edit to fire only
                on its failing condition and confirming it doesn't change a passing task's behavior; fill
                ./PROCESS.md (per-edit verify + blast-radius lines) and APPEND your entry to ./JOURNAL.md.

# 6. BUDGET / GATE
- algorithm:        hill-climb  (--focus all)
- max_iterations:   10          num_trials: 10
- per-iteration optimizer $ cap:  optimizer_usd_per_iter 40   (claude --max-budget-usd, enforced by the CLI itself)
- optimizer_max_turns: 400      (generous; the $ cap is the real per-iteration ceiling)
- max_usd: 400      max_optimizer_usd: 400
- gate:             paired (per-task paired SE — banks real 1-task gains), k_se 0.2
- store:            git          (every iteration committed for an inspectable process)
